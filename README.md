<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s some day 1 mage decks. Had a ton of fun with both these decks and they did pretty well in top 50. Still testing out some cards and definitely can be refined but seems good for day 1. Will be streaming these more tonight and also making a YT vid now <a href="https://t.co/CvinxmsugX">pic.twitter.com/CvinxmsugX</a></p>&mdash; Apxvoid (@Apxvoid) <a href="https://twitter.com/Apxvoid/status/1204568669088448512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2019</a></blockquote>
